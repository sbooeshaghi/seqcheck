# Paper Experiment Workspace

This directory separates paper runs from source fixtures and prior exploratory
audits. Git tracks protocols and analysis code. It ignores generated `runs/` and
large `artifacts/`.

Each run directory must contain its own manifests, tables, validation records,
and normalized specs. Do not seed a final run by copying an entire prior output
directory because that can retain stale specs. Raw FASTQ samples belong in a
separately versioned artifact bundle with checksums.

The cohort review and freeze procedure is defined in
`docs/COHORT_REVIEW_PROTOCOL.md`.
